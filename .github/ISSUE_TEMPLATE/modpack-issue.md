Reports Without Modpack Version Will Be Closed
ANY LOGS regardless of crash-log or lastest.log MUST use 
[This Haste Server](https://haste.romvoid.dev/)
*Even if the issue or bug did not crash the game, it makes finding the cause
of the issue faster if the latest.log is included. If you closed minecraft
and re-started the game after finding the issue I do ask you reproduce the 
issue again so it's present in the current latest.log*
